## Dice Roller
I found the code of this assignment not too difficult as it was just a while loop and setting a range. What was difficult was staying connected to my internet I fixed this by adding another network under my etc/wpa_supplicant... nano for both my phone hotspot and home network. Once my network was up I was able to connect to my GitHub and commit and push code. 

## Calculator 
This code got more difficult because it I had to refresh myself on manual inputs. I kept on haveing errors with indentation because Im using BegalTerm so it doesnt format for you, I fixed this issue by rewritting the lines that had errors and ensuring I used the right tabs. 

## Quadratic Solver
This required inputs for a, b, c that could be manually typed by user and then those values could were added to the Quadratic formula to find the discriminant. The function prints roots for positive outcomes and no real roots for negitive. The hardest part of this assignment was pushing the code to GitHud because I was getting the error "updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do.." 

I fixed this by searching the error where I found this solution... 

git remote add origin [//your github url]

//pull those changes

git pull origin master 

// or optionally, 'git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories' if you have initialized repo in github and also committed locally

//now, push your work to your new repo

git push origin master
