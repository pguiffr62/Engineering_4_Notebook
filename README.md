## Dice Roller
I found the code of this assignment not too difficult as it was just a while loop and setting a range. What was difficult was staying connected to my internet I fixed this by adding another network under my etc/wpa_supplicant... nano for both my phone hotspot and home network. Once my network was up I was able to connect to my GitHub and commit and push code.

This code got more difficult because it I had to refresh myself on manual inputs. I kept on haveing errors with indentation because Im using BegalTerm so it doesnt format for you, I fixed this issue by rewritting the lines that had errors and ensuring I used the right tabs.
