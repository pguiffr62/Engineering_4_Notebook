I found the code of this assignment not too difficult as it was just a while loop and setting a range. What was difficult was staying connected to my internet I fixed this by adding another network under my etc/wpa_supplicant... nano for both my phone hotspot and home network. Once my network was up I was able to connect to my GitHub and commit and push code.
